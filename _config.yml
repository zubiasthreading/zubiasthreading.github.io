description: Born out of the lack of expertise for eyebrow shaping offered by beauty salons in Perth, WA – and throughout Australia- Zubias Threading was incorporated by Sandrine (alias Zubia) and Rizwan in August of 2008.<br /><br />Combining their passion for the beauty therapy industry and their strong belief in natural and organic procedures, Sandrine and Rizwan, Australians with Indian and French backgrounds, noticed the very obvious – yet quite commonly ignored -lack of expertise in the Australian beauty industry.<br /><br />After having consulted countless beauty therapists in the country and contacting various trainers, Sandrine and Rizwan confirmed that the Australian industry was not only unaware of the most effective and accurate facial hair removal technique – called ”threading” but was also unaware of the concept of eyebrow shaping in general.<br /><br />Sandrine and Rizwan both shared a strong desire to make a difference to the community by offering innovative but affordable beauty therapy treatments in Perth – and a desire to offer Australians a service that would change their lifestyle for the better. Hence, they travelled all the way over to India, France and the USA to gain the best training they could get from various eyebrow and facial hair experts. Among the several experts they worked with was Rizwan’s sister, who is well reputed in America for her amazing talent for eyebrow threading and shaping. She helped take their existing knowledge to a different level.<br /><br />What sets Zubias apart from other salons offering affordable beauty therapy services in Perth CBD – and throughout WA – is their advanced technique. Having been exposed to various professionals around the world, along with customers from different origins (and hence different hair and skin types, as well as eyebrow shapes), what they brought back was their own unique threading technique, which combines the expertise of the best threading experts. Sandrine and Rizwan have taken the traditional technique of threading to another level, re-inventing a group of sub-techniques.<br /><br />In August 2008, Sandrine and Rizwan opened their first Zubias Threading beauty salon in Fremantle. Their passion, combined with their expertise in eyebrow shaping and threading treatments, was the key to Zubias Threading’s rapid growth and success. Offering a distinctive service with proven benefits, along with a high standard of customer care, Sandrine and Rizwan make sure not only that their customers will come back, but that they will also recommend Zubias’ services.<br /><br />No other salons or individuals offering affordable beauty treatments in Australia have been able to provide a standard of threading as high as Zubias’.<br /><br />Due to huge support and an overwhelming demand from the community, Zubias Threading has expanded exceptionally quickly throughout the Perth metro area, including beauty salons in Perth CBD. This created news of the salons “sweeping Perth with this new eyebrow shape craze” (West Australian).<br /><br />Being the first and only affordable beauty salon offering professional threading salon in Australia, and with its warm and attractive fit-out and welcoming staff, Zubias Threading is providing a unique service and a competitive point of difference.
